# Health.Net

I am developing Health.Net for two reasons
  1. I wanted to create a sample application for people that shows the use of [ReactiveUI](http://reactiveui.net/), [SQLite.Net](https://github.com/oysteinkrog/SQLite.Net-PCL), [MahApps](http://mahapps.com/) and [Reactive Extensions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609.aspx).
  2. The resulting Health.Net app is pretty useful, and lets me easily track my food intake and body measurements.
